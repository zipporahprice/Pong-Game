# Pong Game - ENCE260 Assignment

<h1> Developed by Zipporah Price and Jake Dalton. </h1>

This project is an implementation of a 'Pong' game, playable only by using two UCFK4 microcontrollers.

# Setting Up Game:
1. Plug the two UCFK4's into a computer.
2. Navigate to the group_311/final folder through the terminal.
3. Run 'make program' twice and place the funkits facing each other.
4. 'Welcome to Pong' text should appear on both microcontrollers. Ready to play.

## Playing the Game:
- From the welcome screen, whichever player wants to start should push down on the NAVSWITCH.
- Each player moves their paddle side to side with the NAVSWITCH to hit the ball back.
- If a player misses the ball, their opponent wins a point.
- The first player to win three points is the winner.
